In order to build a successful real estate business, you need to have both the right systems and the right tools. Here’s how they help you generate more business.

Tools and systems are important for successful real estate agents to have, but it’s also important to realize that they are two different things.

Tools are the things that you use, such as your CRM, your cell phone, and your social network. A system, on the other hand, is a process that you put in place so that you can use those tools to get more leads and more business. A tool without a system doesn’t really do anything.
