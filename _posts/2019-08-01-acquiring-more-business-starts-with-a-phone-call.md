If you’re out of ideas for finding new business, look no further than today’s message.

Like so many other agents, perhaps you wake up each morning asking yourself, **“What do I need to do today to get more business?”&nbsp;**

The answer is simple: **Talk to more people\!** Real estate is what I like to call a “contact sport.” Communicating with people is part and parcel of our job as agents. In fact, what we do can be nicely summed up in three words: contact, contact, contact.&nbsp;

Sometimes, it’s easy to forget to remind the people we contact that we work in real estate and to ask for referrals. Even if you’re just on the phone organizing plans or catching up with a friend or family member, make sure you’re always searching for the right moment to ask them if they know someone who plans to buy or sell anytime soon.

Think about the people in your life and sphere who know, like/love, and trust you the most. These are the people who are your most reliable source for referrals and are usually happy to provide them. You’ll be amazed at how much more business you do once you start reaching out and finding time to get together with them. Surprising as it may seem, **one of the secrets to gaining new business is improving your social life.&nbsp;**

Like with anything else in life, you won’t get an answer unless you ask the question first. It’s important, though, to **make sure you’re striking a balance between business and your personal relationships.** You don’t want to scare off the people closest to you because you’re constantly pressing them for leads.&nbsp;

Building sincere, lifelong relationships with the people you love means knowing there’s a time and a place. Then, when the time is right, kindly remind your loved ones that you’re in real estate and ask if they have any referrals they’d be willing to share with you.&nbsp;
