<p style="text-align: center;"><em>There are three steps you need to take if you want to go from being an agent to the CEO of your business.</em></p>

I’ve been in the real estate business for 27 years, and I started my own office 21 years ago. In that time, we’ve grown to over 400 agents, closed an average of 2,000 transactions per year, and earned over $7 million in commission and $300 million in sales per year.&nbsp;

Through my own journey, I’ve learned there are three steps you need to take if you want to go from being an agent to the CEO of your business.&nbsp;

First, after you reach a certain activity level where you can’t handle all the transactional paperwork and leads yourself, **you must hire a good admin (or admin staff).** When you first start out as an agent, most of your time is devoted to lead generation and getting business. Once you start getting more business, though, you have to spend more time on paperwork and procedures and less time on lead generation. After you see this shift, hiring at least one admin person will help you handle the tasks that are taking time away from income-generating activities like getting leads and referrals.

Second, **get your lead generation in sync.** In other words, you must have a lead generation system in place and be the head of that system. As I indicated above, focus on income-generating activities and delegate the tasks that don’t generate income to your admin.&nbsp;

After the leads start coming in, **it’s time to hire some good buyer and seller agents and build your team.** To keep your team in place, you have to provide value to them, which means you have to supply them with leads and help them grow their business. You also have to train and mentor them.

Being a CEO means wearing many different hats: You have to be in charge of your admin staff, lead generation staff, and sales staff, and be there every day for these people. When you can do that, you can scale your team as high as you want and rake in hundreds of transactions each year.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about how to grow your team and your business or you have any other questions about today’s topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
