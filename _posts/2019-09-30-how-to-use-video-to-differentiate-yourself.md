How can you use video to differentiate yourself from other Realtors? Today I’ll answer this question by explaining how videos will help you get more FSBOs and expired listings, farm an area in your social network to show your expertise, and convert more online leads.

First of all, if you’re going after FSBOs and expired listings, you have to show these sellers that you know their marketplace, and what better way to do that than filming a video in their area? If you’re sending out fliers or mailers, try sending out a video too.

If a seller sees a video of you standing on their street corner talking about real estate, that’s a great way to connect with them.
