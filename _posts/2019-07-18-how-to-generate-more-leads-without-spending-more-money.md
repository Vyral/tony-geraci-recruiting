If you want to get more leads without spending a ton of money, try these three simple methods.

If you want to get a lot of leads without spending a lot of money, you’ll be happy to know that this is definitely possible. There are three main lead sources we recommend if you want to generate more business without putting too much of a strain on your wallet:

**1\. Your database.** This one is obvious. Your database, which is every single person you’ve ever interacted with, is an invaluable source of leads. This includes your family, friends, professional acquaintances, and even people like the receptionist you speak to when scheduling your yearly physical. Reminding people you’re in real estate is an incredible way to find business. Whether by text, phone, email, or mailer, you should be consistently reaching out to the people in your database so that you stay top of mind the next time they need your help.&nbsp;

**2\. Open houses**. Many agents dread hosting these events, but the truth is that they can be very powerful networking opportunities. The people who show up are very likely in the market for a professional like you, so what better way to find business than to let leads come to you? You can even host open houses that aren’t for your specific clients. If you reach out to your teammates, you may find that some of them are willing to let you host an open house for one of their listings. This is something agents in our own office do frequently, and they see great results from it.

**3\. A geographic farm**. When agents talk about farming an area, they don’t mean planting and sowing crops. Rather, farming in real estate is the act of targeting your marketing efforts within a specific location. If you choose to go door to door when you do this, you should always provide something of value to the people you speak to. You may want to consider asking another local business to partner with you to facilitate this. After all, people are bound to be far more receptive to what you have to say if you’re giving them something for their time, whether it be a coupon to a nearby restaurant or a deal with a local contractor. And the more you farm an area, the happier the people you speak to will be to see you.&nbsp;
