It’s easy to focus on the negatives, and this definitely holds true when we think about our own careers. This kind of self-doubt is especially common among real estate agents.

However, the next time a deal isn’t going the way you’d like, I want you to remind yourself of one very simple thing: You’re doing a great job.&nbsp;

I know this might sound counterintuitive, but hear me out. No one is perfect. The key to a job well done is effort, so even when things aren’t quite going your way, **it’s important not to sell yourself short so long as you’re giving it your all.**&nbsp;

It isn’t always easy to remember this, though. When buyers or sellers start taking out their emotions on you, it can feel like their troubles truly are your fault. It’s never fun to be on the receiving end of this kind of backlash, but try to understand that it isn’t always about you.&nbsp;

Sometimes when people are faced with stress, they’ll take it out on the nearest target. And, as you know well, real estate transactions can be very stressful. Therefore, it’s no wonder that agents sometimes face the wrath of disgruntled clients, even when they’ve done nothing wrong.

This is why taking a step back from time to time is so important. As an agent, you’re providing an incredible service. **You’re helping connect people with homes. You’re helping families make major life changes, and that’s the sort of thing that’s bound to make emotions run high.&nbsp;**

With all of this in mind, I implore you to remember all of the good you do the next time you start dwelling on the bad things you’re feeling.&nbsp;
