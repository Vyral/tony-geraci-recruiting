<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I'll share a few tips for how to move from being a part-time real estate agent to a full-time one.</em></p>

How do you make the leap from a part-time agent to a full-time agent? I’ve coached hundreds of agents who’ve successfully made this transition, so I’ll share a few tips and strategies that will help you do the same.

First, go through your budget and figure out how much money you need to make to support you and your family while working in real estate full-time. You need to make this amount for at least one year before you can become a full-time agent.

Next, you need to be prepared to contribute a lot of your time toward this goal.
