I’ve made many mistakes throughout my career, so I want to help you avoid them. Here’s how my five-point checklist can help.

After being in the real estate business for 27 years, I’ve learned that if you don’t keep a checklist of all of the things that have gone wrong so that you don’t repeat them, you probably haven’t been in business for too long.

Today I want to give you some pointers on how to avoid these bad decisions. For example, are your decisions aligned with your daily rhythm? I plan my day based on rhythm so I can take anything that comes up unexpectedly in stride.

If you have any further questions about covering all your bases or your career in real estate in general, feel free to call me or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
