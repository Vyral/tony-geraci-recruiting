In real estate, time-blocking is the perfect way to structure your day-to-day activities. You have certain things that you need to accomplish in a day with just your personal life, but you also have to time-block for work. You need to set up specific times in your workday to prospect, return phone calls to clients, and follow up on current transactions, in addition to the things you need to do in your personal life.

**The key is not to wait until the day of to add things to your calendar.** The more in advance you plan your schedule, the easier it is to stick to that schedule and the more likely you are to get all your tasks done.

Structuring your day is important, but in our career, it’s just as important to make sure that the activities you’re time-blocking for are money-producing activities—prospecting, contacting possible new listings, setting up appointments with new buyers, and so on.

It’s easy to feel bogged down in your day-to-day routine, but **with diligent time-blocking, it’s possible to structure your day to be both productive and less stressful.** These activities are at the core of how your business runs and how you make your money, so it’s crucial to complete them each and every day. I often hear about agents who have one to three ongoing transactions in a given day, which does take up a lot of time—but too many of them forget to make time for those other money-making activities as well.

If you have any questions about today’s topic or would like help with structuring your day, time-blocking, and focusing on money-making activities, reach out to me. I hope to hear from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
